Using the following:
Adding numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters.

The user will click the Generate Password Button and a pop up box will appear asking how many characters to use?


Then a series of pop up boxes will ask if the user wants to use numbers, special characters, uppercase and or lowercase letters.

Afterwards a password will be generated.
